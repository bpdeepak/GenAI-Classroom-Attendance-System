# User Guide

## 5.1 Getting Started
Welcome to the Gen-AI Classroom Attendance System. This guide will help you navigate the features of the application.

### Prerequisites
*   Ensure the system server is running (Contact your IT administrator if the URL `http://localhost:3000` is not accessible).
*   Have digital photos of your students ready for the roster.

## 5.2 Managing the Roster
Before taking attendance, the system must know who the students are.
1.  Click on the **"Manage Roster"** link in the top navigation bar.
2.  **Add a Student**:
    *   **Name**: Enter the full name.
    *   **Student ID**: Enter the unique roll number (e.g., 1MS21CS001).
    *   **Reference Photo**: Upload a clear, front-facing photo of student.
3.  Click **"Add Student"**. A success message will confirm the addition.

## 5.3 Marking Attendance
1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard** (Home Page).
2.  **Upload Classroom Photo**:
    *   Click the "File Input" area or button.
    *   Select a photo of the entire class (ensure faces are visible).
3.  **Process**:
    *   Click "Process Attendance".
    *   Wait for a moment (approx. 2-5 seconds) while the AI analyzes the image.
4.  **View Results**:
    *   **AI Analysis**: Read the atmospheric assessment at the top. This provides a contextual description of the classroom scene generated by the BLIP vision-language model.
    *   **Attendance Table**: Scroll down to see the list.
        *   **Green Badge**: Student is Present.
        *   **Red Badge**: Student is Absent.

## 5.4 Troubleshooting
*   **"No face found in image"**: The roster photo must have one clear face. Try cropping the image to just the face.
*   **System Error**: Ensure the backend server is running and all required models (face_recognition, BLIP) are installed.
