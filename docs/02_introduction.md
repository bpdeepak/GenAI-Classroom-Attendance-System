# Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview
In the era of Smart Education, administrative efficiency is key. The Gen-AI Classroom Attendance System is an automated solution designed to modernize the traditional roll-call method. By leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Computer Vision and Large Language Models (LLMs), this system eliminates manual errors, saves time, and provides deep insights into classroom dynamics.

## 1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1.  **Automation**: To identify and mark the attendance of multiple students simultaneously from a single group photograph.
2.  **Zero-Shot/One-Shot Learning**: To recognize students based on a single reference image without the need for extensive training per individual.
3.  **Qualitative Analysis**: To go beyond binary (Present/Absent) data and provide contextual atmosphere analysis of the classroom environment using vision-language models.
4.  **User-Centric Design**: To provide a clean, professional, and easy-to-use Dashboard for educators.

## 1.3 Scope
*   **Input**: High-resolution images of classrooms.
*   **Processing**: Face detection, encoding comparison, and VLM analysis.
*   **Output**: Digital attendance records and a natural language summary report.
*   **Target Audience**: Schools, Universities, and Corporate Training Centers.

## 1.4 Methodology
The project follows an Agile development methodology, with iterative cycles of design, implementation, and feedback. We utilize a modern tech stack comprising Next.js for the frontend and Python (FastAPI) for the AI-heavy backend.
